# Tanks!

Tanks is a game i created following a Udemy course using C++ in Unreal Engine. I coded everything myself and decided to take it a step further to implement some extra features highlighted below.

# Main features in Tanks!

 - Tank shooting and movement
 - Implementation of particle systems and sounds
 - Health systems
 - Level design and transitioning
 - Turret AI functionality and logic
 - Pause and Main Menus

# Things I learned from Tanks!

 - Using blueprints is an amazing way to compliment and enhance the functionality of the C++ code
 - Vector math is essential to fundamentally enderstand how to program different logic for various game mechanics
 - Fine tuning the numbers (whether it be the fire rate, movement speed, damage, health, etc.) and playtesting the game yourself is crucial to improving the player experience
