# Tanks!

Tanks is 3D tank shooter game that I created using C++ and blueprints. This is the first game that I dove head first into creating new features myself. I am super proud of how it came and and I am super excited to see that there is also so much that can be improved upon as well!

# Main features in Tanks!

 - Tank shooting and movement
 - Implementation of particle systems and sounds
 - Health systems
 - Level design and transitioning
 - Turret AI functionality and logic
 - Pause and Main Menus

# Things I learned from Tanks!

 - Using blueprints is an amazing way to compliment and enhance the functionality of the C++ code
 - Vector math is essential to fundamentally enderstand how to program different logic for various game mechanics
 - Fine tuning the numbers (whether it be the fire rate, movement speed, damage, health, etc.) and playtesting the game yourself is crucial to improving the player experience

# Mistakes I am improving upon from Tanks!

 - Not EVERYTHING needs to be coded in C++. Sometimes looking at it visually and creating things such as widgets through blueprints is better both for you and the team to understand.
 - Understanding the specifics of the gamelplay framework. I misunderstood the meaning of essential things such as the fucntion of a Game Mode in Unreal, or why I would  prefer to put a HUD widget in my player controller rather than the actual plyaer themself. By the end of making the game, I understood more clearly the intended functions of GameModes, Actors, Player Controllers, and how each of them intertwine in a Gameplay Framework.
